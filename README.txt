When 'Get Projects' is clicked with suitable data added, click the column headings to sort by asc or dcs (it can be hidden)

Side note: I am completely aware of the ethical implications of using images that are not cleared for public use (i.e every image in this folder)
I have simply chosen to ignore this as it's only a website on project management 


if running code on windows terminal:

cd react-assn4
npm install
node index.js   # backend goes to index.js which it set up to handle the new projects added

# in a new terminal tab/window:
npm run dev     # frontend
